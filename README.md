## Verification of Motorola SPI Protocol 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the verification of the Motorola SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol using SystemVerilog and UVM methodology. The aim is to design a robust verification environment for SPI communication, ensuring correct functionality and adherence to the Motorola SPI standard.

The SPI protocol is widely used for high-speed, synchronous serial communication between a master and slave devices in embedded systems. This project demonstrates how to verify SPI transactions, timing, and protocol compliance.

## Features 

Master and Slave Verification: Verification of both SPI master and slave devices.

Support for Motorola SPI Modes: Verification of different clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) settings.

Full UVM Testbench:

UVM Agents for master and slave

Sequencers, Drivers, Monitors, and Scoreboards

Transaction-level modeling of SPI frames

Protocol Compliance Checking: Ensures proper data transfer, timing, and handshake signals.

Stimulus Generation: Randomized and directed test scenarios for corner-case testing.

Waveform Analysis: Functional coverage and waveform dump for debugging.
